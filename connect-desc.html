<h1>Nexcess.net Turpentine Extension for Magento</h1>

<p>Turpentine is a Magento extension to improve Magento's compatibility with
<a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/">Varnish</a>, a very-fast caching reverse-proxy. By
default, Varnish doesn't cache requests with cookies and Magento sends the
<em>frontend</em> cookie with every request causing a (near) zero hit-rate for Varnish's cache.
Turpentine provides Varnish configuration files (VCLs) to work with Magento and
modifies Magento's behaviour to significantly improve the cache hit rate.</p>

<p>Note that this extension is still in <strong>beta</strong> so use on a production site should
be considered carefully. There are already some sites using it in production,
but it is certainly not <em>stable</em> yet (ESI support brought significant changes
to how it works).</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Full Magento Page Caching</li>
<li>Requires very little configuration for impressive results</li>
<li>Able to apply new Varnish VCLs (configurations) on the fly, without
restarting/changing Varnish's config files or flushing the cache</li>
<li>Exclude URL paths, request parameters (<em>_SID, _</em>store, etc) from caching</li>
<li>Configure cache TTL by URL and individual block's TTL</li>
<li>Ability to force static asset (css, js, etc) caching</li>
<li>Supports multiple Varnish instances for clustered usage</li>
<li>Hole-punching via Varnish ESI support</li>
<li>Automatic cache clearing on actions (clearing product/catalog/cms page after saving)</li>
<li>Non-root Magento installs (i.e. putting Magento in /store/ instead of /)</li>
<li>Web crawler support for warming the cache</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nexcess/magento-turpentine/wiki/SSL_Support">SSL support</a> through

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>The extension works in two parts, page caching and block (ESI) caching. A
simplified look at how they work:</p>

<p>For pages, Varnish first checks whether the visitor sent a <code>frontend</code> cookie.
If they didn't, then they are served a served a new page from the backend (Magento),
regardless of whether that page is already cached. This is so they get a new
session from Magento. If they already already have a <code>frontend</code> cookie, then
they get a (non-session-specific) page from the backend, with any session-specific
blocks (defined by the ESI policies) filled in via ESI. Note that this is bypassed
for clients identified as crawlers (see the <code>Crawler IP Addresses</code> and
<code>Crawler User Agents</code> settings).</p>

<p>For blocks, the extension listens for the <code>core_block_abstract_to_html_before</code>
event in Magento. When this event is triggered, the extension looks at the block
attached to it and if an <a href="https://github.com/nexcess/magento-turpentine/wiki/ESI_Cache_Policy">ESI policy</a>
has been defined for the block then the
block's template is replaced with a simple ESI template that tells Varnish to
pull the block content from a separate URL. Varnish then does another request to
that URL to get the content for that block, which can be cached separately from
the page and may differ between different visitors/clients.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>This extension is currently in <strong>beta</strong>. There are some sites using it in
production but you should carefully test it on your own dev site before pushing
to production.</li>
<li>Turpentine will <strong>not</strong> help (directly) with the speed of "actions" like adding things
to the cart or checking out. It only caches, so it can only speed up page load
speed for site browsing. It will remove a lot of load on the backend though so
for heavily loaded sites it can free up enough backend resources to have a
noticeable effect on "actions".</li>
<li>By design, the first request from a new visitor will not serve them a cached
page (it will be passed through to the backend so they get a unique session),
so the page load speed will the same as normal (without Varnish/Turpentine).
The second request will also
be somewhat faster than normal, but not full cached-page speed as the ESI blocks
will need to be regenerated and cached for the visitor's new session. Any further
requests will be at full cached-page speed (assuming the pages are already in
the cache).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Plans</h2>

<ul>
<li>Get rid of the layout method for defining ESI blocks to cache, this should
be configurable in the Magento system configuration</li>
<li>Use standard cache-control headers to tell Varnish about the block and page
TTLs</li>
<li>Re-add Varnish 2.1.x support</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>Logging and statistics will show all requests as coming from the same IP address
(usually localhost/127.0.0.1). It should be possible to work around this using
Apache's <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/mod_remoteip.html">mod<em>remoteip</a>
or <a href="http://www.stderr.net/apache/rpaf/">mod</em>rpaf</a>.</li>
<li>Flash messages usually do not display, or display sporadically</li>
</ul>
